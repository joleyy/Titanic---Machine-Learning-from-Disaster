# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
A data science project using machine learning to predict survival on the Titanic.

# Overview

 This challenge is based on real historical data and is a great introduction to predictive modeling.
 In this project, we build predictive models to determine which passengers survived the disaster, using passenger data such as age, gender, class, and more.Buildong an

 This project covers:
